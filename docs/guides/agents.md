# Agent Daemon

The KITT agent daemon runs on GPU servers and receives benchmark jobs from a
central KITT server. This distributed model lets you manage a fleet of GPU
machines from a single control plane -- the server dispatches work and agents
execute it.

---

## How It Works

The agent is a lightweight Flask application that listens for commands over
HTTPS. When the server sends a `run_test` command, the agent resolves the
model to local storage, starts a benchmark in a background thread, and streams
logs back via Server-Sent Events (SSE). A heartbeat thread runs alongside the
daemon, reporting status and GPU utilization to the server at a configurable
interval (default 30 seconds). Settings configured on the server are synced
to the agent via the heartbeat response.

---

## Model Workflow

When a benchmark is dispatched, the agent resolves the model path through the
`ModelStorageManager`:

1. **Check local storage** — if the model is already under the configured
   `model_storage_dir`, use it directly.
2. **Mount NFS share** — if `model_share_mount` is configured, ensure it is
   mounted (via fstab or explicit `sudo mount -t nfs`).
3. **Copy from share** — copy the model from the share to local storage using
   `shutil.copytree`.
4. **Run benchmark** — execute `kitt run` with the local model path.
5. **Cleanup** — if `auto_cleanup` is enabled, delete the local copy after the
   benchmark completes.

This ensures benchmarks always run against a local copy, avoiding NFS latency
during inference.

### NFS share configuration

Set the share source and mount point via the web UI (**Agents > Detail >
Settings**) or during initialization:

```bash
kitt-agent init --server https://server:8080 \
    --model-dir /data/models \
    --share-source nas:/volume1/models \
    --share-mount /mnt/models
```

For passwordless mounts, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`:

```
nas:/volume1/models  /mnt/models  nfs  defaults,nofail  0  0
```

---

## Initializing the Agent

Before starting the agent you must register it with a KITT server:

```bash
kitt-agent init --server https://server:8080
```

This command writes `~/.kitt/agent.yaml` with the server URL, token, agent
name, and optional model storage paths.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--token` | *(empty)* | Bearer token for server authentication |
| `--name` | hostname | Friendly agent name |
| `--port` | 8090 | Port the agent listens on |
| `--model-dir` | `~/.kitt/models` | Local model storage directory |
| `--share-source` | *(empty)* | NFS share source (e.g., `nas:/volume1/models`) |
| `--share-mount` | *(empty)* | Local mount point for NFS share |

---

## Preflight Checks

Run prerequisite checks before starting:

```bash
kitt-agent preflight --server https://server:8080 --port 8090
```

Checks performed:

| Check | Required | How |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Python >= 3.10 | Yes | `sys.version_info` |
| Docker available | Yes | `docker info` subprocess |
| Docker GPU access | Yes | `docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:...` |
| NVIDIA drivers | Yes | `nvidia-smi` subprocess |
| NFS utilities | No | Check for `mount.nfs` in PATH |
| Disk space (>= 50GB) | No | `shutil.disk_usage` on model dir |
| Server reachable | Yes | HTTP GET to `/api/v1/health` |
| Port available | No | `socket.bind` on agent port |

Required checks that fail cause exit code 1.

The install script runs preflight automatically. You can also use the
`--preflight` flag on start:

```bash
kitt-agent start --preflight
```

---

## Starting the Agent

```bash
kitt-agent start
```

On startup the agent:

1. Loads `~/.kitt/agent.yaml` (override with `--config`).
2. Detects hardware — GPU (with unified memory fallback for architectures like
   DGX Spark GB10), CPU, RAM, storage, CUDA version, driver version, environment
   type, and compute capability.
3. Initializes `ModelStorageManager` from config.
4. Registers with the server via `POST /api/v1/agents/register`, sending a full
   hardware fingerprint and detailed hardware info.
5. Starts a `HeartbeatThread` that sends periodic status, GPU utilization,
   memory usage, and storage availability to the server.
6. Launches the Flask app on the configured port with optional TLS.

Use `--insecure` to skip TLS verification during development.

---

## Agent Settings

Settings are stored on the server in the `agent_settings` table and synced to
the agent via the heartbeat response. Edit them from the web UI on the agent
detail page or via the REST API.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `model_storage_dir` | `~/.kitt/models` | Local directory for model copies |
| `model_share_source` | *(empty)* | NFS share source |
| `model_share_mount` | *(empty)* | Local mount point for NFS share |
| `auto_cleanup` | `true` | Delete local model copies after benchmarks |
| `heartbeat_interval_s` | `30` | Seconds between heartbeats (10-300) |

---

## mTLS Communication

When the server uses HTTPS, agent-server communication is secured with mutual
TLS. During `kitt-agent init` KITT generates a client certificate and stores the
paths in `agent.yaml` under the `tls` key:

```yaml
tls:
  cert: /home/user/.kitt/certs/agent.pem
  key: /home/user/.kitt/certs/agent-key.pem
  ca: /home/user/.kitt/certs/ca.pem
```

Both the heartbeat and the registration request present the client certificate.
The server validates it against the same CA.

---

## Systemd Service

For production deployments, install the agent as a systemd service:

```bash
~/.kitt/agent-venv/bin/kitt-agent service install
```

This generates a systemd unit file, installs it via `sudo`, and starts the
service. The agent will survive reboots and restart automatically on failure.

Manage the service:

```bash
kitt-agent service status      # check service status
kitt-agent service uninstall   # stop, disable, and remove the service
```

---

## Updating the Agent

```bash
kitt-agent update              # download and install latest from server
kitt-agent update --restart    # update and restart in one step
```

The `update` command downloads the latest agent package from the KITT server
(`/api/v1/agent/package`) and reinstalls it into the agent's virtual environment.
Use `--restart` to automatically stop the running agent and start the new version.

If the agent is managed by systemd, restart the service after updating:

```bash
kitt-agent update
sudo systemctl restart kitt-agent
```

---

## Heartbeat and Command Dispatch

The `HeartbeatThread` sends a JSON payload to
`/api/v1/agents/<agent_id>/heartbeat` at the configured interval. The payload
includes:

- Agent status (`idle`, `running`, `error`)
- Current task identifier
- GPU utilization percentage (via pynvml)
- GPU memory used in GB
- Storage free space in GB
- Agent uptime

During active benchmarks, the heartbeat interval is automatically increased to
at least 60 seconds to reduce overhead.

The heartbeat response includes:

- `commands` — pending jobs (e.g., quick tests queued from the web UI)
- `settings` — current agent settings for sync

The agent processes each command automatically — for `run_test` commands it
resolves the model, starts the benchmark, and streams log lines back to the
server via `POST /api/v1/quicktest/<test_id>/logs`. Status transitions are
reported via `POST /api/v1/quicktest/<test_id>/status`.

---

## Log Streaming

When a benchmark runs, the agent captures output through a `LogStreamer` and
exposes it as an SSE endpoint at `/api/logs/<command_id>`. The server or any
authorized client can subscribe to this stream for real-time log output.

---

## Checking Status

```bash
kitt-agent status
```

This reads `~/.kitt/agent.yaml` and probes the local agent at
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/status` to report whether the daemon is running
and whether a benchmark is currently active.

---

## Managing Tests

List tests dispatched to this agent:

```bash
kitt-agent test list                    # show all tests for this agent
kitt-agent test list --status running   # filter by status
kitt-agent test list --limit 5          # limit results
```

Stop a running or queued test:

```bash
kitt-agent test stop <test_id>
```

The `stop` command marks the test as failed on the server with an
"Cancelled by user" error and sends a cancel signal to the local daemon
to kill the running process.

---

## Stopping the Agent

```bash
kitt-agent stop
```

Sends `SIGTERM` to the agent process using the PID stored in
`~/.kitt/agent.pid`.
