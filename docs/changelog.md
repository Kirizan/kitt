# Changelog

All notable changes to KITT are documented on this page.

## 1.6.2

- Added real agent campaign dispatch via heartbeat — campaigns on real agents now break into individual quick test rows, queue them one at a time, and poll for completion using the existing heartbeat mechanism
- Campaign executor tracks progress with campaign-level log streaming, handles cancellation, and enforces a 30-minute per-test timeout

## 1.6.1

- Fixed campaign live log streaming stuck on "waiting for logs..." — simulation published events to test ID channels but the detail page subscribed to the campaign ID channel
- Replaced HTMX SSE with JavaScript EventSource + Alpine.js in campaign detail template (matching the quick test pattern)
- Persisted campaign logs to database (`campaign_logs` table, schema v10) so page refresh and post-completion views show log history
- Added `GET /api/v1/campaigns/<id>/logs` endpoint for stored log retrieval
- Fixed SSE connection not closing on cancelled status
- Added cancellation check between iterations in campaign simulation loop

## 1.6.0

- Added interactive campaign creation wizard with step-by-step flow: agent selection, engine compatibility filtering with format badges and platform warnings, searchable model multi-select, and compatibility matrix review
- Added virtual test agents for end-to-end UI testing without real GPU hardware — configurable hardware specs, always-online status, TEST badge in agent list
- Test agents simulate quick test and campaign execution with realistic delays, live SSE log streaming, and fake result generation through the normal ResultStore pipeline
- Campaign and quicktest APIs detect test agents and spawn simulation threads instead of dispatching to agents
- Added result generator producing realistic metrics for throughput, latency, memory, and accuracy benchmarks
- Fixed stored XSS in campaign row rendering by escaping user values
- Added thread safety with `db_write_lock` on all quicktest DB writes
- Added input validation for integer form fields in test agent creation

## 1.5.0

- Added agent-aware engine filtering to quick test UI — engines dynamically populated from API based on selected agent's CPU architecture
- Added `get_engine_compatibility()` in image resolver reporting per-engine ARM64/x86_64 compatibility
- Added `GET /api/v1/quicktest/agent-capabilities` endpoint returning per-agent engine compatibility
- Added override toggle and `force` flag to bypass both platform and model-format validation
- Fixed Devon UI "connecting" stuck state (`htmx:afterSwap` → `htmx:afterRequest`)
- ARM64 engine fixes: Docker CLI static binary, GGUF directory resolution, Ollama local import, vLLM NGC prefix detection

## 1.4.1

- Fixed `SCHEMA_VERSION` not incremented after adding migration v9 (`cpu_arch` column), so the migration never ran on server startup
- Added `cpu_arch` to Postgres fresh-install schema

## 1.4.0

- Added platform-aware image selection for ARM64 and multi-arch support — image resolver considers CPU architecture alongside GPU compute capability
- ARM64 boards (DGX Spark, Jetson Orin) get platform-specific images for engines without multi-arch builds
- Added `--platform` flag to `DockerManager.pull_image()` and `build_image()`
- Added `cpu_arch` field to agent registration, models, and database (migration v9)
- Added `kitt/llama-cpp:arm64` build recipe and Dockerfile for ARM64 hosts
- Fixed arm64/aarch64 architecture mismatch in agent Docker checks — added `normalize_arch()` for consistent naming
- Added `kitt remote` CLI commands for managing remote GPU servers via SSH

## 1.3.0

- Fixed end-to-end remote execution on DGX Spark
- Added agent 404 recovery with hostname fallback and canonical ID sync
- Added model format validation preflight checks — engines declare supported formats and KITT blocks incompatible model/engine combinations before container launch
- Added web UI engine/model compatibility filtering in quick test form
- Added configurable engine images via `~/.kitt/engines.yaml`
- Added `--auto-pull` flag to `kitt run` for automatic engine image pulling
- Added `kitt remote engines setup` command for remote engine image management

## 1.2.1

- Fixed agent benchmark results never reaching the server — `_execute_test()` now reads `metrics.json` from the output directory and forwards it as `result_data` in `_report()`
- Fixed `PermissionError` when `kitt run` defaults to relative `kitt-results/` inside a Docker container — agent now passes `-o` with a writable temp directory to `kitt run`
- Changed default output directory for `kitt run` from relative `kitt-results/` to `~/.kitt/results/` for robustness across environments
- Temp output directories (`/tmp/kitt-results-*`) are cleaned up after agent benchmarks complete
- Fixed architecture mismatch in agent Docker image selection — now checks image arch against host arch before use, falling back to locally-built `kitt:latest` when the registry image is the wrong platform
- Fixed `_report()` using agent name instead of agent ID in URL, causing 404 on result submission
- Fixed Docker entrypoint override for benchmark containers — added `--entrypoint kitt` since the KITT image has `ENTRYPOINT ["kitt", "web"]`
- Reverted Docker CLI package name in Dockerfiles back to `docker.io` — `docker-cli` does not exist in Debian bookworm repos
- Updated hardcoded `kitt_version` references from `1.1.0` to `1.2.1`
- Fixed `_check_auth()` timing attack — replaced `==` with `hmac.compare_digest` for constant-time token comparison
- Fixed thread safety — write lock now wraps entire SQLite transactions (execute + commit), not just the commit
- Fixed `_find_on_share()` path traversal — resolved candidates are validated against the share mount root
- Fixed result detail 404 — `query()` and `get_result()` now include the database ID in returned results
- Fixed `kitt --version` reporting wrong version — now reads from `kitt.__version__` dynamically
- Fixed cleanup button in agent detail page targeting the wrong endpoint (API instead of blueprint)
- Added `@require_auth` to `GET /api/v1/agents/<id>/settings` endpoint
- Added `kitt_image` to migration v8 defaults for consistency with `AgentManager._DEFAULT_SETTINGS`
- Added CSRF protection (`@csrf_protect`) to all state-changing web blueprint endpoints
- Added SHA-256 integrity verification for agent package downloads and build context
- Added Docker environment variable redaction in container start logs
- Added rotating file logging to agent (`~/.kitt/logs/agent.log`, 5MB per file, 3 backups)
- Fixed preflight server reachability check — tries TLS verification first, falls back to insecure for self-signed certs
- Fixed preflight `URLError`-wrapped SSL errors bypassing the insecure fallback
- Removed unused `verify` and `client_cert` parameters from `_report()` function
- Fixed cleanup endpoints bypassing `_write_lock` — extracted `AgentManager.queue_cleanup_command()` method
- Fixed `register()` TOCTOU race — moved SELECT inside write lock to prevent concurrent duplicate inserts
- Fixed `_find_on_share()` glob results not validated against share root (symlink traversal)
- Fixed `_find_on_share()` path validation to use `relative_to()` instead of `str.startswith()` for robustness
- Fixed `csrf_protect` Bearer token exemption — now validates the token before bypassing CSRF check
- Fixed hardcoded `kitt_version` in `run.py` and `json_reporter.py` — now uses `kitt.__version__` dynamically
- Fixed HTMX storage polling in agent detail page targeting JSON endpoint instead of HTML page
- Fixed `tarfile.extractall(filter="data")` incompatibility with Python 3.10 — guarded with version check
- Removed obsolete `docker/agent/Dockerfile` referencing deleted full agent
- Fixed `docker-cli` references in documentation (`docs/reference/docker-files.md`)
- Replaced f-string logger calls with lazy `%s` formatting across agent package and server
- Refactored API token verification — extracted `check_agent_auth()` and `check_agent_auth_by_name()` methods on `AgentManager`, removing raw `_conn` access from API endpoints
- Fixed `tarfile.extractall(filter="data")` guard to use `try/except TypeError` instead of version check, correctly handling Python 3.11.4+ backport
- Fixed `docs/reference/api.md` auth column for `GET /api/v1/agents/<id>/settings` — was incorrectly listed as unauthenticated
- Removed stale `docker/agent/Dockerfile` row from `docs/reference/docker-files.md`
- Removed dead `docker/agent/Dockerfile` reference in stack generator
- Fixed remaining f-string logger calls in `migrations.py` and `agent_install.py`
- Updated stale `kitt_version` in test fixtures from `1.1.0` to `1.2.1`
- Reverted `docker-cli` back to `docker.io` in Dockerfiles — `docker-cli` does not exist in Debian bookworm repos
- Added `save_result()` method to `ResultService` — `report_result` endpoint no longer accesses private `_store` directly
- Fixed `docs/reference/api.md` auth columns for `PATCH` and `DELETE` agent endpoints — were incorrectly listed as unauthenticated
- Fixed `docs/concepts/architecture.md` result reporting URL from `{name}` to `{id}`
- Fixed install script preflight check — `if [ $? -ne 0 ]` was dead code under `set -euo pipefail`, replaced with `if ! command` pattern
- Fixed Docker container leak on health check timeout — container is now stopped before reporting failure
- Removed unused `--foreground` flag from `kitt agent start` proxy command
- Fixed all `docs/reference/api.md` auth columns to match actual `@require_auth` decorators (results, campaigns, models sections)
- Updated README thin agent architecture description to reflect model resolution, Docker benchmark execution, and heartbeat command dispatch

## 1.2.0

- Agent model workflow: copy models from NFS share to local storage, benchmark, cleanup
- Per-agent settings configurable from the web UI (model storage, share mount, cleanup, heartbeat interval)

- Heartbeat throttling during benchmarks (auto-increases interval to 60s minimum)
- `cleanup_storage` command for remote model cleanup via heartbeat dispatch
- Storage usage reporting in heartbeat payload
- Removed full agent (`src/kitt/agent/`) — thin agent (`agent-package/`) is now the only agent
- `kitt agent` CLI commands now proxy to `kitt-agent` binary
- Agent settings REST API endpoints (`GET`/`PUT /api/v1/agents/<id>/settings`)
- Storage cleanup REST API (`POST /api/v1/agents/<id>/cleanup`)
- DB migration v8: `agent_settings` key-value table per agent
- Daemon refactored — consolidated duplicated run methods into shared helpers
- Version policy: every PR must increment version going forward
- `kitt-agent build` command for native-arch Docker image building
